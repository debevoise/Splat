Splat is an interactive, easy-to-use audio sampler and sequencer. Users can create beats by simply pressing keys or clicking. Like Hip Hop? 80s Synth Pop? Disco? Easily customize your sound by selecting one of the built in presets or mix and match up to 8 sounds manually. The sequencer allows users to layer samples over a four measure loop and create dynamic songs.

Splat features a wide bank of samples, presets, and 8 playback channels.

This project is inspired by classic drum machines like the Roland 808 and by later technologies (we're looking at you Ableton Live) that allow producers to build simple but engaging songs by selecting samples and triggering them in a grid layout.
